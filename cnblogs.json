My R7 Lite \nboth of them are about or in the same level of pricing, and mostly the samsungs \nare way so overpriced with stupid specs (Thrifty in specs) while the sonys are also \noverpriced junk, why i say junk, because because its actually useless, why make a phone? make it waterproof when there's a time limit submerging on water (and i get it this is just for accidents) but there's so many reports phone dead with just few second on water, plus when buying the sales person will tell you not to submerge it in sea or salt water? what the F... is that! using the camera on the sony's costs your phone to be on a high temperature, well actually i love there tech but dont like how they make it, bigger sensor on camera, better specs and technology, but, too fancy features that probably not so usefull, and the camera is slow poke! \nWhile the Lenovo Vibe Shot is late comer by introducing its camera phone line up, the price is a bit higher, the phone isn't that fine fully furnished specially the camera app. \n \ni've touched and test them all, what brings me to my final thought the r7 lite \nwas its simplicity, the built quality, fare specs, great camera(fast one) just the right features \nalthough the OS needs a little improvement but not that big issue its just right as it is, \noverall the phone is fast, responsive in speed, elegant and simple and just the right amount of thin. the battery is average it cant last 2 to 3 days of average use surfing for a few hours and casual gaming, text and call. \nbut if your a hard core gaming, hard core surfer specially on 3g/4g connectivity, i doubt it would last 1 day, so it depends on the user. on me its just right. \nthere are just kind'a little bug i encountered its when i try to download third party app (the gallery viewer, the stock android gallery viewer) after installing, using the stock android third party gallery viewer, and deleting some photos on it, the photos were deleted, but when i open it in the oppo file manager the photos are still there, and using the picture viewer i think thats the oppo stock photo viewer managing your photos specially cut copy move and others are not there, you have to use its oppo stock file manager to officially manage and organize your file inside your phone. using third party gallery viewer doesnt solve the problem.", "quote_author": "", "location": "vx4@", "date": "2015-11-26", "model": "R7 lite"}
